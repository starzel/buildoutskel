* Initial release

1.1
---
* Updating to latest blobstorage
  MIGRATION NECESSARY:
  In your backups directories are the directories
  * backups
  * snapshotbackups
  These currently contain the backups. This changes now!
  They are now two more subdirectories:
  * backups/filestorage
  * backups/blobstorage
  * snapshotbackups/filestorage
  * snapshotbackups/blobstorage
  The current backups must be moved to the filestorage directory.
  Be advised that it is undefined if you try to restore a date
  before you used the backup script with blobs!
  You really absolutely should try to run a full backup after you
  updated your code. Do this by editing the backup script
  there is parameter full = False. Change this to True, run the script,
  then change it back.
  ALSO, the script name has been changed. Update your cron jobs accordingly!
